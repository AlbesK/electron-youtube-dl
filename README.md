# simple-ytdl-ui
A simple UI to use youtube-dl to download videos/music.

# Motivation
I like the idea of cross platform apps using web-languages inspired UI and and
another language in the back not just JavaScript. The idea here is building 
for my mvp a simple UI in HTML5, CSS, JavaScript to extend the command line
interface of the youtube-dl open source project. It should be noted this will
be done only for personal use, and I do not condone any mass downloads of videos/music to redistribution! 
(i.e. by using this to download songs which you then share with friends. This
is strictly for personal use!!)

If I make the repo public in the future to showcase web/other backened integration
will do so only by changing the license or making clear that whoever uses it
downloads it, should only use the songs for himself. 

# Github
I have used version control before but thought it would be nice to start again  a
project here rather than just edit the same folders. 

# Branches
For now I will use 2 branches. Another one called 'draft' along 'master'.

(Starting from Thursday 7th May 2020, a month+ after the Covid-19 pandemic, still in isolation in UK)
